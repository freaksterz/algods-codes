 * A tree is represented in the form of array. Where index(i) of the array represent value of a node
 * and the value inside(A[i]) represent the parent index of the tree.
 * Value corresponding to root is -1. Construct the tree.
 * For Eg: 1,-1,1,2,3,1 index 1 is root, with three children at indexes (0, 2 and 5) and
 * index 3 is a child of 2, index 4 is a child of index 3
